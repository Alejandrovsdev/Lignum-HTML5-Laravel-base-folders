            I am a passionate teacher of programming, currently studying for a Higher Technical Degree in Programming, specializing in Backend with Java - Spring | PHP - Laravel | Node.js - Express.js.  I take great pleasure in the learning process and continually seek professional development to achieve set goals.

            My background as a teacher equips me with didactic tools that enhance my ability to teach, learn, and tackle challenges. I thrive in team environments and strive to contribute meaningfully to achieving shared objectives.

            From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about technology. During my teenage years, I attended a specialized computing school where I graduated as a Technician. Although I initially diverted from this path to become a physical education teacher, I am now reigniting my passion for technology through a career in development.
